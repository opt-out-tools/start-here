Here you will find a guide about how we project manage on github. This guide
is intended to make it easier for you to find tasks to get involved with and
how we manage work.

We use Github issues to create, discuss or carry out tasks. Each issue
can take one of three forms, a either a bug, a feature request or feature
implementation (task). 

- Bug: a problem with the code that needs fixing 
- Feature request: an idea for new features 
- Feature implementation: details and suggested steps to be completed to add
 the feature/fix the bug

Bug and feature requests become feature implementations when someone has a
brainwave of how to complete the task. Thus a feature implementation issue
may contain clear instructions of how to complete task.  Each issue should be
labeled with a minimum of two labels, one to indicate priority and the second
to indicate size of task. It should also belong to a milestone. Milestones
are used to indicate the sprint it should be completed for. Our sprints are
two months long. If an issue does not have a milestone then it should have
a backlog label.

We use the Github project boards to organise our tasks for each sprint. We
also have projects with Roadmap in the title that have issues (tasks) that
span longer than one sprint. These issues will have an epic label and will
reference the sub issues that are required to complete it.

Issues may have two kinds of squared bracket labels in the title: 
- [WIP]: indicate you are working on something but not finished in order to
 avoid duplicated work, premature merges, or use this in the title with the
  help wanted label if you want help/collaboration with the issue.
- [MRG]: the contribution is complete and should be subjected to a detailed
review. If the work is in this state, it should reference the feature
request/bug it is fixing 

Issues may also have this in the title:
- RFC: this stands for request for comment and indicates the issue needs input

Workflow for normal sprint:

    Create issues on github (as a result of a planning meeting, or they are created at any time)
    Manage the issue meta data and information as much as possible before the issue is ready to be handled in this current sprint. (This is done in a sprint planning or planning meeting)
    Put the issue in the github project board when it's in the current sprint (this can be seen by the milestone on the issue)
    Make sure in check in meetings that these issues are progressing
    When the sprint changes, clean up the workspace
    Have a sprint planning meeting to decide what goes in workspace again

### Important Operational FYIs

Types of open meeting:

- **Sprint planning** - in first week after a release, to get people to take 
    ownership for tasks for the next sprint, and see what needs more info for people to do it
    
- **Check In** - Like a stand up but biweekly. To make sure tasks assigned at
 sprint planning are moving smoothly

- **Planning** - Where we talk about bigger issues that require people across
 multiple teams. We break these in to smaller tasks and see what depends on what in order to get the task ready to be developed when it's time for it to go in the sprint.

For information on when these meetings are happening, please join us on
slack. Minutes should be taken at these meetings and posted in the relevant
slack channel. You ca get an invite by sending an email to opt.out.tool@gmail.com



Product management FYIs:

    We have meetings mid sprint to talk about issues for the next sprint. This
     helps stay ahead when it comes to specs, that they are ready when it's time to start working.
    Remind people about meetings
    Host a retrospective to reflect with others on how this system is working.
    Someone needs to take ownership of a board. Probably the same person hosting the meeting to make sure tasks are progressing. But without ownership, the board gets outdated and just is cluttered.
