# OOT Structure
There are many challenges to distributed teams such as miscommunication and
productivity. That's at OOT we're trying a decentralized, self-management
system for our teams and it's called a **holacracy**.

## Welcome to Holacracy! 

A [holacracy](https://www.holacracy.org/) is a decentralized, self-management 
system for running purpose-driven organizations, with reduced hierarchy. 
Essentially it means that not all decisions go through one person, but that 
each member of a circle feels empowered to take control over their task and
responsibilities within the circles domain. Let me explain...

The essential elements are:

#### Circles
Circles are like project, and each circle has assigned a clear purpose and 
accountabilities. Each circle has the authority to self-organize internally to 
best achieve its goals. Circles are connected by "Rep Links", which are people 
who attend meetings for both their circle and other circles needed to ensure 
their own alignment with the broader organization’s mission and strategy.

A circle has four core roles:
    • Lead link – The lead link contains the circle’s purpose and is responsible for the circle’s successes and failures throughout its existence. 
    • Secretary –  The secretary schedules meetings and makes note of the meeting’s outlook. Important for inter circle communication
    • Rep Link – The rep link is an elected role used to represent the interests of the circle in other circles

#### Members
Members are you folks, the maintainers. The number of maintainers is not divided equally between the circles. One person can sit in multiple circles and one circle can (should) have multiple people

Tasks
A "task" is an issue on github. An issue (called feature implementation when you’re making one on GH) is an attempt to clearly define the scope of the task, responsibilities and accountabilities of the task.  It is composed of 
    • An objective and description of the task: 
    • Skills and tools/dependencies  needed
    • Time estimate
    • Suggested steps to complete the task
Tasks are decided in a circle through its decision processes (that it decides) and should be updated regularly in order to achieve the circle’s purpose within the shortest time frame. These tasks should live in the circles board on github.
The person that fulfills any given task is empowered to make decisions and execute assignments in the way that they think is best within the circles domain.
