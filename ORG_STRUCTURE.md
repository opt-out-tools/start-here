# OOT structure

There are many challenges to distributed teams such as miscommunication and
productivity. That's why at **OOT** we're trying a decentralized,
self-management system for our teams called **holacracy**.

## Welcome to holacracy!

A [holacracy](https://www.holacracy.org/) is a decentralized, self-management
system for running purpose-driven organizations, with reduced hierarchy.

Essentially it means that not all decisions regarding the organization go
through one person, but that the organization is a community of teams and
members that are empowered to take control over their task and responsibilities
within their domain.

### Teams

Teams are like self-sustained projects that have a clear purpose and
responsibilities. Each team has the authority to self-organize to best achieve
their goals.

**OOT** is currently comprised of the following teams:

- **Data Team:** In charge of researching and developing a machine learning model for the
automatic detection of online misogyny on Twitter. Responsible for managing and
maintaining the following repositories:

### Members

Members are you folks, the maintainers. The number of maintainers is not divided equally between the circles. One person can sit in multiple circles and one circle can (should) have multiple people

Tasks
A "task" is an issue on github. An issue (called feature implementation when you’re making one on GH) is an attempt to clearly define the scope of the task, responsibilities and accountabilities of the task.  It is composed of
    • An objective and description of the task:
    • Skills and tools/dependencies  needed
    • Time estimate
    • Suggested steps to complete the task
Tasks are decided in a circle through its decision processes (that it decides) and should be updated regularly in order to achieve the circle’s purpose within the shortest time frame. These tasks should live in the circles board on github.
The person that fulfills any given task is empowered to make decisions and execute assignments in the way that they think is best within the circles domain.

“If it wasn’t open, it didn’t happen”

“Under represented people are underestimated”
