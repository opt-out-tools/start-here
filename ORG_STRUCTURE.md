# OOT structure

There are many challenges to distributed teams such as miscommunication and
productivity. That's why at **OOT** we're trying a decentralized,
self-management system for our teams called **holacracy**.

## Welcome to holacracy!

A [holacracy](https://www.holacracy.org/) is a decentralized, self-management
system for running purpose-driven organizations, with reduced hierarchy.

Essentially it means that not all decisions regarding the **OOT** organization go
through one person, but that **OOT** is a community of teams and
members that are empowered to take control over their task and responsibilities
within their domain.

### Teams

At **OOT**, teams are self-sustained projects that have a clear purpose and
responsibilities. Each team has the authority to self-organize to best achieve
their goals.

**OOT** is currently comprised of the following teams:

- **Data Team:** In charge of researching and developing a machine learning model for the
automatic detection of online misogyny on Twitter. Responsible for managing and
maintaining the following repositories:
  - [model-online-misogyny](https://github.com/opt-out-tools/model-online-misogyny)

infrastructure. Responsible for managing and maintaining the following

blog post and campaigning issues in the following repositories:
